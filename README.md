# foam-extend-VOFInterpolationSchemes
Assorted VOF Interpolation Schemes for foam-extend 3+. Tested against foam-extend-4.1. 

Contains 4 VOF interpolation schemes for algebraic VOF advection, adapted to work with foam-extend. The code was originally ported to OpenFOAM by Roenby and Jasak from eariler versions of foam-extend. Newer versions of extend do not carry these schemes due to code refactoring. The libraries should work out of the box.

Feel free to use and share improvements :)
Special thanks to Santiago Lopez Castano and shout out to the OpenFOAM community at Discord.
